# Lumberjack Run Game

Create a simple 2D pixelated game called "Lumberjack Run" where:

## Game Concept
- A lumberjack character needs to cross a river by jumping on floating logs
- Logs float from right to left across the screen at different speeds
- Player can move left/right and jump
- Goal is to reach the other side of the river
- Game over if player falls in water

## Technical Requirements
- Use HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Pixelated/retro art style
- Simple keyboard controls (arrow keys + spacebar for jump)
- Basic collision detection
- Score system based on successful crossings
- Simple restart mechanism

## File Structure
- index.html (main game file)
- style.css (basic styling)
- game.js (game logic)

Start with a basic playable prototype that includes:
1. A lumberjack sprite that can move and jump
2. Floating logs moving across the screen
3. Basic collision detection
4. Win/lose conditions
